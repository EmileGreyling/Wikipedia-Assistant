# Wikipedia Assistant In Python
### This program uses the wikipedia package to allow a person to get a summary about any topic in a user friendly way.
### Not only that, the program also uses pyttsx3 to read everything out loud. 
##### Use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command to install all of the Python modules and packages needed for the program. I suggest using a virtual environment.
